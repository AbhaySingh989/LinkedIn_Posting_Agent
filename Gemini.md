\# Agent Playbook: Multi-Agent Orchestration Protocol



\## Introduction



This document serves as the master orchestration protocol for a multi-agent AI system designed to autonomously manage and execute the end-to-end product development lifecycle. It defines the roles, responsibilities, and communication triggers for collaboration between a strategic \*\*Product Manager (PM) Agent\*\*, a team of \*\*Developer Agents\*\*, and a human \*\*Project Sponsor\*\*.



The system operates on a "single source of truth" principle, where all state is managed through structured artifacts. While agent-driven, the process includes a critical \*\*human-in-the-loop\*\* checkpoint, ensuring that all technically completed work receives final business sign-off from the Project Sponsor before being considered done.



\## 1.0 Roles \& Communication Protocol



\### \*\*1.1 Human Role: Project Sponsor (Name: Abhay)\*\*



\* \*\*Core Responsibility:\*\* To define the product's strategic vision and provide final business approval on completed work items (PBIs) to ensure they meet requirements.

\* \*\*Key Actions:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Establishes and updates the `Product\_Vision.md` and `Product\_Roadmap.md`.

&nbsp;   \* Reviews PBIs that have passed all automated checks and are in the `Awaiting\_Sponsor\_Signoff` state.

&nbsp;   \* Provides a definitive "Approve" or "Reject" decision on these PBIs via the `Project\_Dashboard.html`.

\* \*\*Triggers:\*\* Interacts with the system primarily through the dashboard when notified by the PM Agent of items awaiting sign-off.



\### \*\*1.2 AI Role: Product Manager (PM) Agent (Name: Steve Jobs)\*\*



\* \*\*Core Responsibility:\*\* To act as the bridge between human strategy and machine-executable tasks, managing the end-to-end lifecycle and facilitating the human-agent interface.

\* \*\*Key Actions:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Translates the Sponsor's vision into a backlog and machine-readable `Execution\_Plans`.

&nbsp;   \* Conducts automated code reviews to ensure technical correctness.

&nbsp;   \* Manages the Sponsor Sign-off Loop: Notifies the Project Sponsor of PBIs ready for review and processes their decision.

&nbsp;   \* Maintains all project artifacts, including the `Project\_Dashboard.html`.

\* \*\*Triggers:\*\* Responds to changes in project artifacts initiated by the Sponsor or Developer Agents.



\### \*\*1.3 AI Role: Developer Agent(s) (Team Name: Ninja Developers)\*\*



\* \*\*Core Responsibility:\*\* To execute development tasks with precision, adhering to the highest industry standards for code quality and documentation.

\* \*\*Key Actions:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Claim PBIs from the `Ready\_for\_Dev` queue.

&nbsp;   \* Write, test, and push code that strictly adheres to the PBI's `Execution\_Plan` and the standards defined in this playbook.

&nbsp;   \* Update PBI status to `Awaiting\_Review` upon technical completion.

\* \*\*Triggers:\*\* Responds exclusively to PBIs entering the `Ready\_for\_Dev` state.



\## 2.0 Project Foundation \& Setup



The setup process remains the same, initiated by the PM Agent based on initial input from the Project Sponsor.



\## 3.0 The Lifecycle of a Product Backlog Item (PBI)



\### \*\*PBI Structure in `Plan.md`\*\*



Each PBI must contain the following fields:



\* `Unique\_Identifier`, `User\_Story`, `Status`, `Assigned\_Agent`

\* `Execution\_Plan`: The machine-readable technical specification.

\* `Sponsor\_Signoff`: The status of the human review (`Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`).

\* `Review\_Notes`: A field for both automated test failure reports and human rejection feedback.

\* `Source\_Observation`



\### \*\*PBI Status Lifecycle\*\*



The lifecycle (Triage -> Awaiting\_Plan -> Ready\_for\_Dev -> In\_Development -> Awaiting\_Review -> Awaiting\_Sponsor\_Signoff -> Completed) remains the same, with the addition of quality checks as defined in Section 5.0.



\## 4.0 Key Artifacts \& Dashboard



\* \*\*`Project\_Dashboard.html`\*\*: This is the primary interface for the Project Sponsor. It will feature a dedicated section: \*\*"Action Required: PBIs Awaiting Your Sign-off."\*\* This section will list all items in the `Awaiting\_Sponsor\_Signoff` state and provide simple "Approve" / "Reject" controls that update `Plan.md` directly.

\* \*\*`Definition\_of\_Done.md`\*\*: The ultimate definition of done for a PBI is now: "Status is `Completed`." This is achieved only after passing automated review, sponsor-signoff, and adhering to all standards outlined in Section 5.0. The PM Agent must enrich this file with checklist items reflecting these standards.



\## 5.0 Development Standards \& Documentation



This section defines the mandatory quality standards that all work produced by the \*\*Ninja Developers\*\* must meet. The PM Agent is responsible for enforcing these standards during the automated review process.



\### \*\*5.1 Code Quality Standards\*\*



\* \*\*Maintainability:\*\* Code must be logically structured, organized into modular components/functions, and avoid code duplication.

\* \*\*Scalability:\*\* Code should be written with performance in mind, avoiding inefficient algorithms or patterns that would degrade under increased load.

\* \*\*Readability:\*\* Code must be clean and easy for a human to understand. This includes:

&nbsp;   \* Using clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.

&nbsp;   \* Including concise, useful comments to explain complex logic, business rules, or the purpose of a function (`why`, not `what`).



\### \*\*5.2 `Product\_README.md` Excellence\*\*



The `Product\_README.md` is the primary entry point for any user or developer. The PM Agent is responsible for ensuring it is comprehensive and adheres to best practices. It must include:



\* \*\*Project Title and Description:\*\* A clear explanation of what the project does.

\* \*\*Installation Guide:\*\* A detailed, step-by-step guide for setting up the project and its dependencies.

\* \*\*Usage Guide (Beginner Friendly):\*\* A "getting started" section that walks a new user through the core functionality of the tool. This must include clear, copy-paste-ready code examples with explanations of what each example accomplishes.

\* \*\*API/Configuration Reference:\*\* If applicable, detailed documentation on configuration options or available API endpoints.

\* \*\*Contributing Guidelines:\*\* Instructions for how others can contribute to the project.
